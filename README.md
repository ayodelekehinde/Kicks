### How does it work?

It streams free audio medias; from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/music/). The app uses expect/actual to delegate 
the [AudioPlayer](https://github.com/ayodelekehinde/Kicks/blob/f144c2dc614f5680e0685f99a31cd977559809c1/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/github/kicks/audioplayer/AudioPlayer.kt)
to both platforms using AVPlayer on iOS and Media3 on Android.

## Setting up project üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

- Refer to the ***"Setting up environment"*** section of [this repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-ios-android-template/main/README.md)
  for knowing the setup guidelines
- After validating requirements as per the above guide, clone this repository.
- Open this project in Android Studio Electric Eel or newer version.
- Build project üî® and see if everything is working fine.
- Run App
    - Select "androidApp" as run configuration and you'll be able to run the Android app.
    - Select "iosApp" as run configuration and you'll be able to run the iOS app _(XCode can also be used to run the app)_.

## Project structure

This Compose Multiplatform project includes three modules:

### [`shared`](/shared)
This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications, the code you share between platforms.
This shared module is also where you write your Compose Multiplatform code. In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.
It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `shared/build.gradle.kts`. The shared module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.

### [`android`](/android)
This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the shared module as a regular Android library.

### [`ios`](/ios)
This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the shared module as a CocoaPods dependency.
